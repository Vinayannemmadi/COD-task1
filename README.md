Description:
Creating a basic calculator in Java is an excellent project for beginners to understand the fundamental concepts of programming, such as control structures, methods, and user input. This simple application performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Description

The basic calculator application in Java involves creating a console-based program that allows users to input two numbers and an arithmetic operator. The program then processes the inputs to perform the desired operation and outputs the result.
Steps to Create the Calculator

    1. Setup Environment: Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed. Use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA for efficient coding and debugging.

    2. Import Required Packages: Use java.util.Scanner for capturing user input.

    3. Create the Main Class:

    4. Explanation:
        Scanner Object: To read user inputs.
        Variables: num1 and num2 for numbers, operator for the chosen operation, and result to store the outcome.
        Switch Case: To handle the arithmetic operations based on the operator input.
        Error Handling: Basic check to prevent division by zero.

    5. Execution: Run the program. It prompts for two numbers and an operator, performs the calculation, and displays the result.

This simple calculator program introduces fundamental Java programming concepts and serves as a building block for more advanced applications.

Conclusion: 
In conclusion, the Basic Calculator implemented in Java effectively performs fundamental arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The project showcases core Java programming skills, including user input handling, control flow, and modular function design. It serves as a practical example of applying object-oriented principles to solve simple computational problems. This calculator can be further enhanced with additional features like a graphical user interface or more complex mathematical functions for broader usability.
